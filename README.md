# Restaurant Reviews web app
---
#### FEND p6

## Project Overview

For this project, I had to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application, taking a static design that was lacking accessibility and convert it to be responsive on a range of different sized displays, at the same time making it accessible for screen readers use. For creating a seamless offline experience with the site I used service worker.

### How to run the app

You can open Live project [here](https://elenanovikova.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews/). <br>
<br> **OR** <br>
1. Download/clone this project's repository from [here](https://github.com/ElenaNovikova/Restaurant-Reviews/).

2. In project's folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. Note, that ES6 code will run only in browsers that have support of it, older browsers and devices most likely do not support ES6, therefore the Restaurant Reviews app will not work properly on it. Please be sure to get it updated.
